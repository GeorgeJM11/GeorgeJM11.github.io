  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>We have been exploring media including different types of media, what it is and fakes in the media. We also created a identity map for homework including sections on where we've lived and live, family, hobbies, future goals, and types of media we use and want to use.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>Read and review other pupil’s identity map using google docs.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>Yes, I managed to review more than half the class’s homework and left constructive and kind feedback (apart from when they supported Chelsea…grrrrr!)</td>
