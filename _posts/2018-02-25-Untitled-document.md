Review of scratch project

For the last term I have been coding my scratch game, Pop Shot. Now after several weeks of work the game is complete. Here is how I did it:

Week 1, Planning Stage:

In the first week we were planning our games. At first I decided on a different game to the one I actually went with in the end. This meant that I wrote out my plan for the other game, and then, once I had changed my mind, wrote another plan out for Pop Shot. I was pleased with my plan as I included a lot of content.

Week 2, Started Coding game:

In the second week I started to code my game. Most of the work I did in this week I eventually changed although I did keep all of the sprites that I inserted such as the gun, balloons and backdrop.

Week 3, Coding:

This lesson I encountered a few problems which took up a fair bit of the time, however I did catch up at home. I made the balloons move to the top of the screen, inserted a target sprite which followed the mouse pointer and also created a score variable

Week 4, Coding:

Week 4 was definitely my most successful weak. I inserted five hearts in the top corner (lives), which disappeared one by one as you let more balloons float away. Once all of the lives had gone the game would end. I also increased the difficulty of the game.

Week 5, Peer and self assessing:

This week we were assessing our own and other's games. I peer assessed two pupils games which both happened to be car games. I gave and received constructive feedback and I used the improvement points that I received to make my game better.

Week 6, Final improvements:

This week I just made some small changes to my game. I made the gun move where it was shooting, changed the backdrop and also published my game. I also had a chance to have a look at other people's games.

Overall I am please with my game. I particularly like the addition of the gun which makes the game look more realistic. Also I am pleased with how simple yet effective my game is.

If I was to do my game again I would try to create more levels or more guns to make it more exciting.
