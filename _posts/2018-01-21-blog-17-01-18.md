    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>In order to make the balls jump I had to code the movement and then repeat it many times. However when I did this the balls didn't move smoothly, it was stopping and starting, in the end I solved the problem but I had to use a lot of code and this made the game lag.</td>

    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>Rather than taking an idea from another game I decided to not use any inspiration from any other games.</td>
