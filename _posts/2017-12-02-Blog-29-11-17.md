    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>Started coding the game including making rocket move and fire.</td>

    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>Code boss ship and make it move and get hit.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>Yes, I managed to make my boss ship move and when it is hit by the laser it hides.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>This lesson was slightly harder than usual as we had to copy a large amount of code. Even when I thought I was done I realised I had made a couple of errors in the code and so I corrected them.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>We did not really need any help this lesson as we were just copying off the board. This meant that all of the work we did was independent.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I reflected back on the work I had done and made some changes to improve the game.For example one thing I changed was the speed of the bullet. In Mr. Keens game the bullet wasn't very quick so I changed it in my own.</td>

    <td>When I copied out the code the first time I made a couple of errors.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I could take more care when copying the code the first time so that I donâ€™t have to go through it all again to make changes.</td>
