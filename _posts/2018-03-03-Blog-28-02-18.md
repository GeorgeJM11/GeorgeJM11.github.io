    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>The last level of Maze proved to be very tricky and took a very long time to complete. I tried many, many times to get the sprite to the end point and in the end, after many unsuccessful attempts, i completed the level. I was particularly pleased with this as many of my classmates gave up.</td>
